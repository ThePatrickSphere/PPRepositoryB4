Programming Experience:


9th Grade Year: In the space below, write 2-5 sentences describing your programming experience in the previous year, even if you went to another school.

In 9th grade, I focused on lists and other data structures in Python. Using those data structures and libraries, I have made random generators, bots, and mini-games. In addition I have made immersive environments in virtual reality and codes to operate machines using min-breadboards.



10th Grade Year: In 2-5 sentences, describe each of the programming projects you’ve completed this year.  Think back to Block 1, Block 2/3, and your Passion Project (if that applies).


In 10th grade, I have made card and die generators using random modules, which "draw cards" and "roll die" to a user's desire. I have also used virtual reality to practice fitness and mindfulness; I then tracked my usage data in ways that are simple and direct.



What is one part or element of programming that you would like to improve or grow in this year?

I would like to improve on finding out the possibilities for writing the code on my own, rather than relying on code that's already given.


What is one part of programming or this class that you feel like challenges you more than others?

I feel like this class challenges me to think like a computer instead of like a human. When we do these projects we think like humans and then work those thoughts into terms a computer can understand.


What is your “goal” with computer programming or Computational Thinking?  This answer can be focused on your time at school, or it could describe how you want to experience college or your future career.

My goal in computational thinking is to be able to logically find solutions to problems through a computer code.
